# Retroboard

Retroboard is a sample Rust library that exposes functions that could be used to maintain agile _retrospective_ boards for developers. 

This is designed as a sample application to illustrate the use of Redis as a backing store for an application where we might otherwise have chosen a store like **MongoDB** or **mySQL**.
